Make sure the engine is cool to prevent hot oil burns. To access the underbelly, lift the car if needed using jacks or ramps.","Look beneath the engine to find the oil drain plug. If you're not sure where it is exactly, check the owner's manual. To collect the spent oil, place the drain pan underneath the drain plug.","Carefully remove the oil drain plug by turning it counter clockwise with a wrench or socket set. Keep in mind that the oil could be heated. After the drain stopper is loose, fully remove it and let the old oil run out into the drain pan. Make sure that all of the oil is captured by the drain pan.","Locate the oil filter, typically located near the oil pan. Use an oil filter wrench to loosen the oil filter in a counter clockwise direction. Once loosened, carefully unscrew and remove the old oil filter. Be prepared for oil to spill out when removing the filter, so ensure the drain pan is positioned to catch any spills.","Apply a small layer of fresh engine oil to the rubber gasket on the new oil filter before installing it. This facilitates the creation of a good seal and makes removal simpler when the next oil change is performed.","Carefully screw the new oil filter onto the engine by hand in a clockwise direction until it is snug. Avoid over-tightening the filter, as this can damage the gasket or cause leaks.","After the old oil has completely drained, clean the drain plug and look for any damage to the washer or gasket. If required, swap out the gasket or washer. Using a wrench or socket set, carefully reinstall the drain plug and tighten it firmly.","Find and take off the oil filler cap located atop the engine. As directed by the manufacturer and contained in the owner's manual, use a funnel to add the right kind and quantity of new engine oil.","After adding new oil, replace the oil filler cap securely. Start the engine and let it run for a few minutes to circulate the new oil throughout the engine. Turn off the engine and allow it to sit for a few minutes to allow the oil to settle","To check the oil level, remove the oil dipstick while the engine is off, clean it, fully insert it again, and then remove it once again. If extra oil is needed to get it to the right level, add it.","Properly dispose of the old oil and oil filter according to local regulations.
