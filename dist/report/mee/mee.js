It consists of a mass, called a bob, suspended from a fixed point by a massless string or rod.  \n            The simple pendulum swings back and forth due to gravity\'s force when it is released from its resting position. Simple harmonic motion can adequately explain the motion of a single pendulum under certain assumptions, such as minimal displacement angles and the absence of air resistance.<br>\n            A single pendulum\'s length, mass, and gravitational acceleration determine its behaviour. Longer pendulums take longer to complete a single swing because of their longer durations. Assuming that the mass is concentrated at the end of the pendulum and has no effect on its distribution, this duration is roughly independent of the mass of the bob.<br>\n            One can use a variety of equations, including those derived from Newton\'s laws of motion or energy conservation principles, to examine the motion of a single pendulum. It is a basic concept in physics that helps to explain oscillatory motion and finds utility in many other domains, such as seismology and timekeeping (such as in vintage pendulum clocks).<br>\n            While a simple pendulum is a theoretical model, it helps us understand the basic principles of pendulums. Here are some key points about its motion:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Swinging motion: When displaced from its resting position, the bob swings back and forth due to gravity pulling it downwards.</li>\n                <li>Periodic motion: The swinging motion repeats itself at regular intervals, with a constant time period (T) which is the time for one complete swing back and forth.</li>\n                <li>Limited applicability: The simple pendulum formula (T = 2π√(L/g)) is most accurate for small swing angles (ideally less than 15 degrees). For larger swings, the restoring force isn\'t perfectly proportional to the displacement, affecting the period.</li>\n            </ul>\n            Applications of simple pendulum include: Mechanical clocks, seismometers, metronomes etc.<br>\n            Below is the youtube video that illustrates what the simple pendulum experiment is all about.\n            <div><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/02w9lSii_Hs?si=qovIosqap6jw66kD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n        ',n.appendChild(s),e.appendChild(n);const l=document.createElement("h2");l.textContent="APPARATUS",e.appendChild(l);const d=document.createElement("div");d.innerHTML="\n            <img src=../../asset/images/44fb61dc3281459dd53f.png>\n            <img src=../../asset/images/e67ff6f3183f9aae13b6.jpeg>\n        ";const c=document.createElement("p");c.textContent="Diagram of a simple pendulum and a stopwatch.",d.appendChild(c),e.appendChild(d);const h=document.createElement("section"),m=document.createElement("h2");m.textContent="RESULTS",h.appendChild(m);const p=document.createElement("div");p.innerHTML='<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PTN0HFD7Utw?si=aW1F5YGp6qyti6Qe" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>',p.textContent="Watch video for procedures",h.appendChild(p);const u=document.createElement("p");u.textContent="After watching the video, the table below illustrates an example of how the table of results will look like after performing the experiment.",h.appendChild(u);const g=document.createElement("table");g.border="1",g.style.width="100%";const f=document.createElement("thead");f.innerHTML="\n            <tr>\n                <th>TRIALS</th>\n                <th>LENGTH (m)</th>\n                <th>PERIOD (s)</th>\n            </tr>\n        ",g.appendChild(f);const E=document.createElement("tbody");[{trials:"1",length:"0.5",period:"1.98"},{trials:"2",length:"0.6",period:"2.23"},{trials:"3",length:"0.7",period:"2.48"},{trials:"4",length:"0.8",period:"2.73"},{trials:"5",length:"0.9",period:"2.99"},{trials:"6",length:"1.0",period:"3.24"}].forEach((e=>{const t=document.createElement("tr");t.innerHTML=`\n                <td>${e.trials}</td>\n                <td>${e.length}</td>\n                <td>${e.period}</td>\n            `,E.appendChild(t)})),g.appendChild(E),h.appendChild(g),e.appendChild(h);const b=document.createElement("section"),y=document.createElement("h2");y.textContent="ANALYSIS:",b.appendChild(y);const w=document.createElement("p");w.textContent="When you have tabulated the results, using the equation below, calculate the Period.",b.appendChild(w);const T=document.createElement("p"),C=document.createElement("span");C.textContent="T = 2π√(L/g)………..

This helps create a shear force distribution profile for the entire beam, not just a specific point. While increasing the load helps understand the relationship with shear force, using too many small increments can be time-consuming. </p>\n            <p> The procedure can be optimized by using strategically chosen load values that cover a representative range. Zeroing the measuring instruments before each load application minimizes errors due to initial imperfections in the setup. Using calibrated instruments (load cells, dial gauges) ensures the accuracy of the measurements. Also repeating the experiment multiple times increases the accuracy and reliability </p></li>\n            <li><strong>WHAT WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT ASPECT OF THE EXPERIMENT?</strong> \n            <p>-The most difficult aspect was ensuring accurate load positioning and beam alignment. can have a major impact on the distribution of shear force. Precisely aligning the load and making sure the beam is level can be difficult, particularly with manual systems. In order to increase accuracy, jigs and alignment tools might be used.</p> \n            <p>-The most difficult part was minimizing friction. Throughout the experiment, friction may arise at the weight application locations and beam supports, among other places. This friction may cause inaccuracies in the shear force levels that are measured. Utilizing lubricants, smooth surfaces, or specific bearings can all help reduce friction.</p></li>\n            <p><strong>NAME AND DESCRIBE ANY APPARATUS OR METHOD YOU KNOW CAN BE USED TO PERFORM THIS SAME EXPERIMENT:</strong></p>\n            <p><strong>Strain Gauge Technique:</strong></p>\n            <ul>\n            <li>Attach Strain Gauges: Bond strain gauges to the beam at specific locations, typically near support points.</li>\n            <li>Apply Load: Gradually apply a load using weights or another loading mechanism.</li>\n            <li>Deform Under Load: As the beam bends under the load, the strain gauges undergo deformation, causing a change in their electrical resistance.</li>\n            <li>DAQ System: A data acquisition (DAQ) system amplifies and records the minute voltage changes from the strain gauges.</li>\n            <li>Data Analysis: Convert the recorded voltage data into strain using the gauge's calibration factor.

Following a step-by-step procedure allows for logical data collection, reducing confusion and ensuring that critical steps are not overlooked. The design and execution of the experiment focus on precise measurements, logical flow, and relevance to practical applications, making it effective in achieving its objectives. Below is an evaluation of its suitability based on its methodology and outcomes. he experiment's accuracy is ensured through the use of a well-structured setup. Instruments such as the cam and follower mechanism, along with the dial gauge, are integral to obtaining precise and reliable measurements. The cam and follower mechanism is inherently designed to demonstrate the principles of converting rotational motion into reciprocating or oscillating motion, providing a clear and measurable output. Additionally, the inclusion of calibrated tools minimizes the possibility of measurement errors and enhances the reproducibility of the results</p>\n\n        <h3>What was the most difficult aspect of the experiment?</h3>\n        <ul>\n            <li>The most difficult aspect was setting up the required meticulous adjustments to the dial gauge to measure the follower’s displacement accurately.
