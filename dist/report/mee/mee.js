It consists of a mass, called a bob, suspended from a fixed point by a massless string or rod.  \n            The simple pendulum swings back and forth due to gravity\'s force when it is released from its resting position. Simple harmonic motion can adequately explain the motion of a single pendulum under certain assumptions, such as minimal displacement angles and the absence of air resistance.<br>\n            A single pendulum\'s length, mass, and gravitational acceleration determine its behaviour. Longer pendulums take longer to complete a single swing because of their longer durations. Assuming that the mass is concentrated at the end of the pendulum and has no effect on its distribution, this duration is roughly independent of the mass of the bob.<br>\n            One can use a variety of equations, including those derived from Newton\'s laws of motion or energy conservation principles, to examine the motion of a single pendulum. It is a basic concept in physics that helps to explain oscillatory motion and finds utility in many other domains, such as seismology and timekeeping (such as in vintage pendulum clocks).<br>\n            While a simple pendulum is a theoretical model, it helps us understand the basic principles of pendulums. Here are some key points about its motion:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Swinging motion: When displaced from its resting position, the bob swings back and forth due to gravity pulling it downwards.</li>\n                <li>Periodic motion: The swinging motion repeats itself at regular intervals, with a constant time period (T) which is the time for one complete swing back and forth.</li>\n                <li>Limited applicability: The simple pendulum formula (T = 2π√(L/g)) is most accurate for small swing angles (ideally less than 15 degrees). For larger swings, the restoring force isn\'t perfectly proportional to the displacement, affecting the period.</li>\n            </ul>\n            Applications of simple pendulum include: Mechanical clocks, seismometers, metronomes etc.<br>\n            Below is the youtube video that illustrates what the simple pendulum experiment is all about.\n            <div><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/02w9lSii_Hs?si=qovIosqap6jw66kD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n        ',n.appendChild(a),e.appendChild(n);const o=document.createElement("h2");o.textContent="APPARATUS",e.appendChild(o);const d=document.createElement("div");d.innerHTML="\n            <img src=../../asset/images/44fb61dc3281459dd53f.png>\n            <img src=../../asset/images/e67ff6f3183f9aae13b6.jpeg>\n        ";const c=document.createElement("p");c.textContent="Diagram of a simple pendulum and a stopwatch.",d.appendChild(c),e.appendChild(d);const h=document.createElement("section"),u=document.createElement("h2");u.textContent="RESULTS",h.appendChild(u);const m=document.createElement("div");m.innerHTML='<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PTN0HFD7Utw?si=aW1F5YGp6qyti6Qe" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>',m.textContent="Watch video for procedures",h.appendChild(m);const p=document.createElement("p");p.textContent="After watching the video, the table below illustrates an example of how the table of results will look like after performing the experiment.",h.appendChild(p);const g=document.createElement("table");g.border="1",g.style.width="100%";const f=document.createElement("thead");f.innerHTML="\n            <tr>\n                <th>TRIALS</th>\n                <th>LENGTH (m)</th>\n                <th>PERIOD (s)</th>\n            </tr>\n        ",g.appendChild(f);const y=document.createElement("tbody");[{trials:"1",length:"0.5",period:"1.98"},{trials:"2",length:"0.6",period:"2.23"},{trials:"3",length:"0.7",period:"2.48"},{trials:"4",length:"0.8",period:"2.73"},{trials:"5",length:"0.9",period:"2.99"},{trials:"6",length:"1.0",period:"3.24"}].forEach((e=>{const t=document.createElement("tr");t.innerHTML=`\n                <td>${e.trials}</td>\n                <td>${e.length}</td>\n                <td>${e.period}</td>\n            `,y.appendChild(t)})),g.appendChild(y),h.appendChild(g),e.appendChild(h);const b=document.createElement("section"),w=document.createElement("h2");w.textContent="ANALYSIS:",b.appendChild(w);const E=document.createElement("p");E.textContent="When you have tabulated the results, using the equation below, calculate the Period.",b.appendChild(E);const v=document.createElement("p"),T=document.createElement("span");T.textContent="T = 2π√(L/g)………..

This helps create a shear force distribution profile for the entire beam, not just a specific point. While increasing the load helps understand the relationship with shear force, using too many small increments can be time-consuming. </p>\n            <p> The procedure can be optimized by using strategically chosen load values that cover a representative range. Zeroing the measuring instruments before each load application minimizes errors due to initial imperfections in the setup. Using calibrated instruments (load cells, dial gauges) ensures the accuracy of the measurements. Also repeating the experiment multiple times increases the accuracy and reliability </p></li>\n            <li><strong>WHAT WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT ASPECT OF THE EXPERIMENT?</strong> \n            <p>-The most difficult aspect was ensuring accurate load positioning and beam alignment. can have a major impact on the distribution of shear force. Precisely aligning the load and making sure the beam is level can be difficult, particularly with manual systems. In order to increase accuracy, jigs and alignment tools might be used.</p> \n            <p>-The most difficult part was minimizing friction. Throughout the experiment, friction may arise at the weight application locations and beam supports, among other places. This friction may cause inaccuracies in the shear force levels that are measured. Utilizing lubricants, smooth surfaces, or specific bearings can all help reduce friction.</p></li>\n            <p><strong>NAME AND DESCRIBE ANY APPARATUS OR METHOD YOU KNOW CAN BE USED TO PERFORM THIS SAME EXPERIMENT:</strong></p>\n            <p><strong>Strain Gauge Technique:</strong></p>\n            <ul>\n            <li>Attach Strain Gauges: Bond strain gauges to the beam at specific locations, typically near support points.</li>\n            <li>Apply Load: Gradually apply a load using weights or another loading mechanism.</li>\n            <li>Deform Under Load: As the beam bends under the load, the strain gauges undergo deformation, causing a change in their electrical resistance.</li>\n            <li>DAQ System: A data acquisition (DAQ) system amplifies and records the minute voltage changes from the strain gauges.</li>\n            <li>Data Analysis: Convert the recorded voltage data into strain using the gauge's calibration factor.

The motion is periodic, meaning it repeats itself in a regular cycle. The time period of a pendulum is the time it takes for the bob to complete one full swing back and forth.</p>\n        <p>A conical pendulum is a type of pendulum in which a mass (called the bob) is attached to a string or rod of fixed length and moves in a horizontal circular path, making the string trace the surface of a cone.

Energy losses due to friction at the flywheel's axle, the pulley, and the contact between the string and the pulley reduce the amount of energy transferred to the flywheel. As a result, the rotational kinetic energy of the flywheel is less than the potential energy initially calculated for the falling weight. Even with energy losses from friction and other sources, the outcomes should adhere to the principle of energy conservation. The total of the flywheel’s rotational kinetic energy plus the energy lost (for example, to friction) should roughly equal the potential energy of the falling weight.</p>\n        <p>Inaccurate measurements can cause errors. Inaccuracies in measuring the height of the falling weight, its mass, or the angular velocity (ω) of the flywheel can result in errors in energy calculations. Additionally, timing errors, particularly when using manual tools such as a stopwatch, can further compromise the reliability of the data. Although the theoretical energy values may differ from the experimental results due to losses and assumptions, the observed trends—such as increased energy input resulting in higher angular velocity—should match theoretical expectations, validating the experiment's findings</p>\n    ",e.appendChild(m);const p=document.createElement("section");p.innerHTML="\n        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n        <p>At the end of this experiment, we determined the moment of inertia of a flywheel and to use this to verify Newton’s laws as applied in this case.

The procedure suggests using a protractor or angular velocity sensor to measure the flywheel's rotational speed, minimizing human error and ensuring precise data collection. Additionally, tools such as a scale for measuring weight and a ruler for determining height provide the necessary accuracy for reliable energy calculations. A stopwatch is also included to accurately time the fall of the weight, which is essential for determining accurate energy transfer rates. The experimental procedure is also well-suited for time efficiency. The setup is relatively simple and does not require complex or specialized equipment. Basic components, such as a pulley, flywheel, and weight, are sufficient for conducting the experiment. This simplicity allows the experiment to be set up quickly, minimizing the time required for preparation. Moreover, the clear guidelines provided in the procedure reduce the likelihood of errors during setup, ensuring that the experiment can proceed smoothly without unnecessary delays. Furthermore, the analysis phase is simple and efficient. Comparing potential energy with rotational kinetic energy involves basic calculations, and the results can be quickly interpreted to evaluate the system's efficiency.
