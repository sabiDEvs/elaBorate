It consists of a mass, called a bob, suspended from a fixed point by a massless string or rod.  \n            The simple pendulum swings back and forth due to gravity\'s force when it is released from its resting position. Simple harmonic motion can adequately explain the motion of a single pendulum under certain assumptions, such as minimal displacement angles and the absence of air resistance.<br>\n            A single pendulum\'s length, mass, and gravitational acceleration determine its behaviour. Longer pendulums take longer to complete a single swing because of their longer durations. Assuming that the mass is concentrated at the end of the pendulum and has no effect on its distribution, this duration is roughly independent of the mass of the bob.<br>\n            One can use a variety of equations, including those derived from Newton\'s laws of motion or energy conservation principles, to examine the motion of a single pendulum. It is a basic concept in physics that helps to explain oscillatory motion and finds utility in many other domains, such as seismology and timekeeping (such as in vintage pendulum clocks).<br>\n            While a simple pendulum is a theoretical model, it helps us understand the basic principles of pendulums. Here are some key points about its motion:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Swinging motion: When displaced from its resting position, the bob swings back and forth due to gravity pulling it downwards.</li>\n                <li>Periodic motion: The swinging motion repeats itself at regular intervals, with a constant time period (T) which is the time for one complete swing back and forth.</li>\n                <li>Limited applicability: The simple pendulum formula (T = 2π√(L/g)) is most accurate for small swing angles (ideally less than 15 degrees). For larger swings, the restoring force isn\'t perfectly proportional to the displacement, affecting the period.</li>\n            </ul>\n            Applications of simple pendulum include: Mechanical clocks, seismometers, metronomes etc.<br>\n            Below is the youtube video that illustrates what the simple pendulum experiment is all about.\n            <div><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/02w9lSii_Hs?si=qovIosqap6jw66kD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n        ',n.appendChild(a),e.appendChild(n);const r=document.createElement("h2");r.textContent="APPARATUS",e.appendChild(r);const o=document.createElement("div");o.innerHTML="\n            <img class='halfImg' src=../../asset/images/44fb61dc3281459dd53f.png>\n            <img class='halfImg' src=../../asset/images/e67ff6f3183f9aae13b6.jpeg>\n        ";const s=document.createElement("p");s.textContent="Diagram of a simple pendulum and a stopwatch.",o.appendChild(s),e.appendChild(o);const l=document.createElement("section"),c=document.createElement("h2");c.textContent="RESULTS",l.appendChild(c);const d=document.createElement("div");d.innerHTML='<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PTN0HFD7Utw?si=aW1F5YGp6qyti6Qe" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>',d.textContent="Watch video for procedures",l.appendChild(d);const h=document.createElement("p");h.textContent="After watching the video, the table below illustrates an example of how the table of results will look like after performing the experiment.",l.appendChild(h);const u=document.createElement("table");u.border="1",u.style.width="100%";const p=document.createElement("thead");p.innerHTML="\n            <tr>\n                <th>TRIALS</th>\n                <th>LENGTH (m)</th>\n                <th>PERIOD (s)</th>\n            </tr>\n        ",u.appendChild(p);const m=document.createElement("tbody");[{trials:"1",length:"0.5",period:"1.98"},{trials:"2",length:"0.6",period:"2.23"},{trials:"3",length:"0.7",period:"2.48"},{trials:"4",length:"0.8",period:"2.73"},{trials:"5",length:"0.9",period:"2.99"},{trials:"6",length:"1.0",period:"3.24"}].forEach((e=>{const t=document.createElement("tr");t.innerHTML=`\n                <td>${e.trials}</td>\n                <td>${e.length}</td>\n                <td>${e.period}</td>\n            `,m.appendChild(t)})),u.appendChild(m),l.appendChild(u),e.appendChild(l);const w=document.createElement("section"),v=document.createElement("h2");v.textContent="ANALYSIS:",w.appendChild(v);const b=document.createElement("p");b.textContent="When you have tabulated the results, using the equation below, calculate the Period.",w.appendChild(b);const T=document.createElement("p"),E=document.createElement("span");E.textContent="T = 2π√(L/g)………..

This helps create a shear force distribution profile for the entire beam, not just a specific point. While increasing the load helps understand the relationship with shear force, using too many small increments can be time-consuming. </p>\n            <p> The procedure can be optimized by using strategically chosen load values that cover a representative range. Zeroing the measuring instruments before each load application minimizes errors due to initial imperfections in the setup. Using calibrated instruments (load cells, dial gauges) ensures the accuracy of the measurements. Also repeating the experiment multiple times increases the accuracy and reliability </p></li>\n            <li><strong>WHAT WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT ASPECT OF THE EXPERIMENT?</strong> \n            <p>-The most difficult aspect was ensuring accurate load positioning and beam alignment. can have a major impact on the distribution of shear force. Precisely aligning the load and making sure the beam is level can be difficult, particularly with manual systems. In order to increase accuracy, jigs and alignment tools might be used.</p> \n            <p>-The most difficult part was minimizing friction. Throughout the experiment, friction may arise at the weight application locations and beam supports, among other places. This friction may cause inaccuracies in the shear force levels that are measured. Utilizing lubricants, smooth surfaces, or specific bearings can all help reduce friction.</p></li>\n            <p><strong>NAME AND DESCRIBE ANY APPARATUS OR METHOD YOU KNOW CAN BE USED TO PERFORM THIS SAME EXPERIMENT:</strong></p>\n            <p><strong>Strain Gauge Technique:</strong></p>\n            <ul>\n            <li>Attach Strain Gauges: Bond strain gauges to the beam at specific locations, typically near support points.</li>\n            <li>Apply Load: Gradually apply a load using weights or another loading mechanism.</li>\n            <li>Deform Under Load: As the beam bends under the load, the strain gauges undergo deformation, causing a change in their electrical resistance.</li>\n            <li>DAQ System: A data acquisition (DAQ) system amplifies and records the minute voltage changes from the strain gauges.</li>\n            <li>Data Analysis: Convert the recorded voltage data into strain using the gauge's calibration factor.

Energy losses due to friction at the flywheel's axle, the pulley, and the contact between the string and the pulley reduce the amount of energy transferred to the flywheel. As a result, the rotational kinetic energy of the flywheel is less than the potential energy initially calculated for the falling weight. Even with energy losses from friction and other sources, the outcomes should adhere to the principle of energy conservation.

The procedure suggests using a protractor or angular velocity sensor to measure the flywheel's rotational speed, minimizing human error and ensuring precise data collection. Additionally, tools such as a scale for measuring weight and a ruler for determining height provide the necessary accuracy for reliable energy calculations. A stopwatch is also included to accurately time the fall of the weight, which is essential for determining accurate energy transfer rates. The experimental procedure is also well-suited for time efficiency. The setup is relatively simple and does not require complex or specialized equipment. Basic components, such as a pulley, flywheel, and weight, are sufficient for conducting the experiment. This simplicity allows the experiment to be set up quickly, minimizing the time required for preparation. Moreover, the clear guidelines provided in the procedure reduce the likelihood of errors during setup, ensuring that the experiment can proceed smoothly without unnecessary delays. Furthermore, the analysis phase is simple and efficient. Comparing potential energy with rotational kinetic energy involves basic calculations, and the results can be quickly interpreted to evaluate the system's efficiency.

A power source's speed, direction, and torque can be altered using gears, which are essential parts of mechanical systems. The teeth is precisely machined to ensure proper meshing with other gears. The gears are typically made of metal (e.g., steel, brass) or plastic, depending on application and load requirements. This experiment typically involves studying the operation, characteristics, and design of spur gears using pre-fabricated models (labelled A1 to A5).

The driving and driven gears must be precisely aligned for gear systems to function. Any misalignment, whether brought on by setup problems or manufacturing flaws, might result in an unequal load distribution and more friction between the teeth. Higher wear rates, inefficiencies, and inaccurate performance metrics like torque and power transmission might arise from this. Additionally, misalignment can cause noise and vibrations, which can make interpreting data even more difficult.</p>\n\n        <h4>Frictional Losses</h4>\n        <p> Insufficient or excessive lubrication can alter the frictional forces between the gear teeth, affecting efficiency and wear results. In the spur gear experiment, the lubrication system is essential for lowering friction between the gear teeth. But too much or too little lubrication might have a big effect on the outcome. The results of the experiment may be distorted if there is insufficient lubrication since the increased friction could cause greater temperatures, more wear, and decreased efficiency. On the other hand, excessive lubrication may cause the system to behave unexpectedly, changing power losses and influencing how torque is transmitted between the gears.</p>\n\n        <h4>Gear Manufacturing Defects</h4>\n        <p>Inaccurate gear tooth profiles, surface roughness, or improper dimensions can affect meshing and performance. Manufacturing Defects in the gears themselves can also introduce errors in the experiment. Even slight imperfections in the gear teeth, such as incorrect tooth profiles, rough surfaces, or dimensional inaccuracies, can affect the meshing between gears. These defects can lead to increased friction, noise, and wear, which in turn can alter the performance characteristics being measured.

It is frequently used in garages and mechanical workshops to raise large objects, such automobiles.</p>\n        <p>The screw jack operates on the basis of the idea that a revolving screw, when spun, produces an upward or downward force along its axis. The threads of the screw provide the mechanical advantage, requiring less effort to lift the weight over a greater distance. The theory revolves around simple machines and includes concepts like velocity ratio, mechanical advantage, and efficiency. This experiment shows how the mechanical advantage of a screw jack allows for the comparatively easy lifting of heavy loads. Because of the friction between the screw threads and other parts, the efficiency is usually less than 100%.</p>\n        <p>The aim of this experiment is to calculate the Velocity Ratio, Mechanical Advantage and Efficiency of the screw jack.</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>The velocity ratio is the ratio of the distance moved by the effort to the distance moved by the load.</li>\n            <li>The mechanical advantage is the ratio of the load lifted to the effort applied</li>\n            <li>The efficiency of a screw jack measures how effectively the input effort is converted into useful work to lift the load. It is the ratio of the mechanical advantage to the velocity ratio</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>To carry out the screw jack experiment, the apparatus is assembled and set up on a stable surface. The equipment includes a screw jack, a known weight (load), a handle or lever for applying effort, and tools to measure the dimensions of the screw jack. The purpose of the experiment is to assess the velocity ratio, mechanical advantage, and efficiency of the screw jack.</p>\n        <p>The procedure starts with securely placing the load on the platform of the screw jack, ensuring stability throughout the experiment to reduce errors from movement. Effort is then applied by rotating the handle, causing the screw to lift the load. The handle is turned continuously until the load is raised by a measurable height.</p>\n        <p>During the experiment, specific measurements are taken to evaluate the screw jack's performance. The applied effort is measured using a spring balance or a similar tool. The load lifted is recorded as the weight placed on the screw jack platform. The radius of the effort wheel is measured to calculate the handle's rotational circumference, and the screw's pitch the distance between consecutive threads is also determined.</p>\n        <p>Using these measurements, the velocity ratio is calculated as the distance moved by the effort compared to the distance moved by the load. The mechanical advantage is then calculated as the ratio of the load lifted to the effort applied. Lastly, the efficiency (η) of the screw jack is determined by comparing the mechanical advantage to the velocity ratio and expressing the result as a percentage.</p>\n        <p>The procedure is repeated with different loads and effort values to study how the screw jack's performance varies under different conditions. Each trial requires careful measurements and observations to ensure accurate and reliable results.

This theoretical measure represents the potential mechanical advantage the device can provide. However, the actual mechanical advantage, calculated as the ratio of the load lifted to the effort applied, is usually lower than the velocity ratio due to friction. The efficiency of the screw jack, expressed as the ratio of the mechanical advantage to the velocity ratio in percentage terms, indicates how effectively the input effort is converted into useful work to lift the load. Efficiency is generally less than 100% because of energy losses caused by friction between the screw threads and other components of the jack. One of the most significant observations during the experiment is the effect of friction on the performance of the screw jack. Friction plays a dual role: while it causes energy losses that reduce efficiency, it also helps the screw jack hold the load in position without slipping when the effort is removed. This self-locking feature is a practical advantage of the screw jack in real-world applications.</p>\n    </div>\n',e.appendChild(l);const c=document.createElement("section");c.innerHTML='\n    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n    <div class="conclusion-content">\n        <p>At the end of this experiment, we were able to determine the velocity ratio of the machine and also able to obtain an equation for the relationship between load and effort and also plot graph on base of increasing load illustrating the variation of effort, effect on friction and efficiency.

The experiment involves applying a controlled amount of effort, gradually rotating the screw jack handle to lift the load. The effort applied is measured consistently using a spring balance, while the load lifted is recorded with accuracy. This controlled approach minimizes any potential fluctuations in the effort applied or the measurements taken, thereby reducing the possibility of errors that could affect the results.

The experiment involves determining the velocity ratio, the relationship between the load and effort, and evaluating the limiting efficiency of the machine. A wheel and axle is a simple machine that consists of a circular wheel connected to a central axle. The machine operates by applying a force (effort) to the wheel, which causes the axle to rotate and lift or move a load.</p>\n        <ul>\n            <li><strong>Wheel:</strong> The larger circular component that applies the effort force.</li>\n            <li><strong>Axle:</strong> The smaller central shaft around which the wheel rotates, supporting the load.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>The fundamental principle of this machine is mechanical advantage, where the size difference between the wheel and axle enhances the force applied to the load. The Simple Wheel and Axle Experiment helps in understanding how force is transmitted in a simple machine. By analyzing the velocity ratio, the relationship between load and effort, and determining the efficiency, students can gain insights into mechanical advantage, friction, and how simple machines can be used to make work easier. In this Experiment, we will calculate for Velocity Ratio (VR): The velocity ratio of a wheel and axle is the ratio of the distance moved by the effort (wheel) to the distance moved by the load (axle). A larger wheel radius results in a higher velocity ratio, making it easier to lift the load with less effort. In this experiment, Load and Effort Relationship is also used. It is the relationship between the load and effort is expressed through mechanical advantage (MA), which is the ratio of the load lifted to the effort applied. This indicates how efficiently the machine transforms the applied effort into work on the load. Efficiency losses often arise due to friction between the wheel and axle. Limiting efficiency occurs when friction between the wheel and axle reduces the system’s effectiveness. As a result, the efficiency is typically below 100%, due to the energy lost to friction.</p>\n    ",e.appendChild(n);const i=document.createElement("section");i.innerHTML=`\n        <h2>APPARATUS</h2>\n        <ul>\n            <li><div><p>Wheel on an axle</p><img class='halfImg' src=../../asset/images/8fbfa50cf593ae54c288.png></div></li>\n            <li><div><p>Metre rule</p><img class='halfImg' src=${h}></div></li>\n            <li><div><p>Weights</p><img class='halfImg' src=${u}></div></li>\n            <li><div><p>Pulley</p><img class='halfImg' src=${d}></div></li>\n            <li><div><p>Protractor</p><img class='halfImg' src=${r}></div></li>\n            <li><div><p>Stopwatch</p><img class='halfImg' src=${s}></div></li>\n            <li><div><p>Hanger</p><img class='halfImg' src=${c}></div></li>\n        </ul>\n    `,e.appendChild(i);const a=document.createElement("section");a.innerHTML='\n        <h2>RESULTS</h2>\n        <div class="video-container">\n            <p>The youtube video below illustrates the procedures for a Wheel and axle experiment.</p>\n            <iframe src="https://youtu.be/h_kk0NSg-hI" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong>NOTE: this is an example of how the table looks like not the actual table input the values calculated or gotten from the experiment into the tables under each column correctly.</strong></p>\n        <table>\n            <thead>\n                <tr>\n                    <th>Load (W)</th>\n                    <th>Effort (E)</th>\n                    <th>V.R</th>\n                    <th>Load if 100% efficient W1 = (E x V.R)</th>\n                    <th>Effect of Friction (W1 - W)</th>\n                    <th>Mech.
