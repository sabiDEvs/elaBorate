# elaBorate
A project that will revolutionize ELA report writing

Development Guidelines:
    
    Naming Conventions:
        variables: should be named explicitly as nouns
        functions: should be explicitly named as verbs
    
    Declaration:
        *Only let and const should be use for declaration
        *Use more of function expressions and arrow functions
    
    Semantics: Use html semantics tags{HTML5}
    
    Build with accessibility, SEO and optimization in mind
    
    Employ SOLID principles taking single responsibility and loosely coupled functions/objects as priority
    
    Use factory functions/modules instead of class/object constructors
    
    Comment on every necessary line of code with short but explanatory functions

    Employ programming/coding best practices throughout the development

    Create any extra javascript file you will need in the module section of the src folder and then import it to the javascript file you need it for

    To use font import it to your javascript file

    To use css import it to your javascript file

    All your coding should be done in the src folder

    Set the template of the html files to be generated in individual html files in the src folder

    Your html aside the template should be dynamically generated with javascript from your javascript file

    import images if you want to use them to your javascript file

    Search online for webpack guides for more information

    Ask questions any time you have to

    Create a new branch for every feature you will work on

    After completion merge and commit a pull request




*GETTING STARTED*
    Fork the repo your github account
    Clone it to your local machine
    Update your node version to the latest
    Install webpack
    Install Dependencies(they will all be sent to the slack channel)
    Write your code on the src folder
    Type npm run build on your cli to bundle your src codes
    OR
    Type npm run watch on your cli to allow webpack bundle your codes anytime you make changes to them
    OR
    Type  npm start on your cli to allow webpack bundle your codes anytime you make changes to them and also refresh your browser
    All this should be done while you must have navigated to the project's  directory on your local machine
    After working and testing features, make sure you commit with meaningful messages
    Have fun and don't destroy our codebase


*LET'S GO*
